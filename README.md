**Problem With Technical Debt:** I find the above article interesting because it highlights a looming problem with many software-related projects today. Technical debt, which often originates from coding malpractice and lack of organization in a project, is metaphorized in this article as an accumulation of future work. I find this metaphor interesting because it helps me truly understand why this problem is referred to as a "debt". This issue acts as a "complexity tax", facing software engineers with the responsibility to resolve the lack of project organization. The article states how a significant portion of corporate budget is dedicated towards resolving technical debt associated with software-related projects.

**Potential Solutions:**
I also found the article's solutions towards minimizing technical debt to be of interest. The article suggests that in order to help mitigate technical debt, corporations can modernize their systems and software choices in order to simplify applications and remove outdated technologies. Although technical debt cannot be entirely eliminated, it is necessary to be aware of it and act upon it in earlier stages.
